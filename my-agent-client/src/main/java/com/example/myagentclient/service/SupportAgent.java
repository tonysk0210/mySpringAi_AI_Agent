/**

 * the support tools exposed by the MCP server, and lets the LLM drive the whole
 * resolution autonomously: it reads the email, calls whatever MCP tools it needs
 * to identify the customer and gather facts, decides on an action, takes it, and
 * logs a ticket.
 * <p>
 * We never orchestrate the individual tool calls here — the {@code ToolCallbackProvider}
 * supplied by the {@code spring-ai-starter-mcp-client} auto-configuration is handed to
 * the {@code ChatClient}, and Spring AI runs the tool-calling loop for us. Our job is
 * just to give the model its instructions (the system prompt) and the email to act on.
